## ohmyfood project

This is a multipage project based around ohmyfood. This company allows the user to choose a location in which they would like to view restaurants in. For this particular project, the location was Paris, Belleville. Each menu page is linked back to the homepage via the arrow button in the top left-hand corner.

####Animations to look out for:

The loader on the homepage.
The hover feature on the heart icon.
The delay as the menu items are loading.
The green tick slide and rotate when a menu item has been hovered over.
